MNL48 is currently a 20-member (as of 3/21/2024) girl group based in the Philippines. <br><br>

Formed on April 2018, it started out with 48 official members divided into 3 Teams (sub-units), Team MII, Team NIV and Team L. All non-promoted members would be put in Team Trainee or would be referred to as "Kenkyuusei". Members would be allowed to graduate from the group unlike other groups which would usually discourage leaving. To balance out with members' graduations, auditions would be held from time-to-time to recruit multiple members to become Kenkyuusei and eventually promoted to a Team. Since December 15, 2022 the Team System has been abolished, leaving each promoted member, no matter which team, just under MNL48.<br><br>
With the large volume of members in the group, not all members would be chosen to participate in each song (with a few exceptions). The lineup of members chosen to participate in a song would be called a "Senbatsu" with usually one member as the center and main focus in the song. In order to create equal opportunities for most members, members who fail to make it to a single's A-side song's Senbatsu would sometimes be put to a special Senbatsu called "Undergirls" and participate in another song (usually the coupling track).<br><br>
Initially planned to have a theater in Eton Centris in Quezon City (which is still undergoing construction up to this day), the group's name would be named after their location which would be Metro MaNiLa. The 48 (often mistaken for being the group's number of members) would be a nod to their mother group AKB48 in Japan. As AKB48 Groups' motto would be "Idols you can meet", MNL48 would be of no exception. The group would hold multiple events to bond with fans. One of such would be the Senbatsu Election where fans can vote for the next Senbatsu for the next single. Another event would be the Handshake Event where fans can buy tickets to have a handshake and converse with their members for a bit.<br><br><br>
